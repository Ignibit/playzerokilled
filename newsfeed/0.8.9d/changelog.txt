0.8.9d
Added support for player nicknames on Steam and Oculus Store. No more random PC names! 
Fixed servers hanging from time to time. Because of this many people couldn't play, as the game connected them with server hanged. Now it is working correctly.
Added destructibles to Suburbs map.
Fixed disappearing ladders. Damn ladders. Also we’ve disabled hand collision with ladders so it’s much easier to climb.
Region menu is no longer rendering over the top of your hands.
Increased Domination and Tournament HUD size, so you can see much better.
Domination spawn blockers are now working much better (you can shot through them, but cannot move through them).
Domination kills give +50 points for your team.
Moved spawn points a little bit on Nuclear so it’s more balanced and harder to spawnkill.
Minor fixes in connecting to server, should fix problem with people connecting to empty server while there are ones with players available.
